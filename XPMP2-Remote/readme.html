    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <P>
        For full documentation please visit
        <a href="https://twinfan.gitbook.io/livetraffic/setup/installation/xpmp2-remote-client">LiveTraffic/XPMP2 Remote Client on GitBook</a>,
        which also includes more details on installation.
    </P>

    <h2>Installation / External Visuals</h2>

    <P>The typical basic installation is very simple:</P>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You run a networked setup, in which one computer is the master.
            The master also runs the latest version of XPMP2-based plugins
            (like LiveTraffic, xPilot) just as usual
            (the <i>senders</i>, because they will send the traffic);</li>
        <li>On all other computers on the network install the
            XPMP2 Remote Client as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Move the <code>XPMP2-Remote</code> folder under X-Plane's
                    <code>Resources/plugins</code> folder as with any other plugin.</li>
                <li>Install the same set of CSL Models, that your senders use, under the
                    <code>XPMP2-Remote/Resources</code> folder.
                    It is not required to rebuild the same folder structure
                    as CSL models are identified by internal names,
                    but all models need to be in reach if you want planes
                    to appear the same way as at your senders.</li>
            </ul></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Installation / Local TCAS Concentrator</h2>

    <P>You have several XPMP2-based plugins (like LiveTraffic, xPilot,
    referred to as the senders) running in parallel and want to see
    all their traffic on TCAS
    (and not only the traffic of the plugin which happens to have TCAS control):</p>
    
    <P>Install XPMP2-Remote on the computer running the senders:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Move the <code>XPMP2-Remote</code> folder under X-Plane's
            <code>Resources/plugins</code> folder as with any other plugin.</li>
        <li>In this setup you don't even need to add all your CSL models
            as the Remote Client doesn't actually render planes,
            but for technical reasons at least <strong>one</strong>
            model is still required.</li>
    </ul>
